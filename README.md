STC\-1000+
========

Improved firmware for fermentation and Arduino based uploader for the STC-1000 dual stage thermostat.

![STC-1000](http://img.diytrade.com/cdimg/1066822/11467124/0/1261107339/temperature_controllers_STC-1000.jpg)

The STC-1000 is a dual stage (heating and cooling) thermostat that is pretty cheap to buy. I (and a low of fellow homebrewers) use them to control the fermentation temperature of beer.

The goal of this project is twofold
 * To create the means to reprogram the STC-1000 with a custom firmware
 * To create a custom firmware, suited for fermenting beer

The first goal is achieved by using an Arduino (UNO and Pro Mini 5v verified to work) with a sketch to act as a programmer, and the second by using the SDCC compiler and GPUTILS.

Features
--------

* Both Fahrenheit and Celsius versions
* Up to 6 profiles with up to 10 setpoints.
* Each setpoint can be held for 1-999 hours (i.e. up to ~41 days).
* [Web browser profile editor](http://goo.gl/z1KEoi) 
* Approximative ramping
* Somewhat intuitive menus for configuring
* Separate delay settings for cooling and heating
* Configurable hysteresis (allowable temp swing) from 0.0 to 2.5°C or 0.0 to 5.0°F
* User definable alarm when temperature is out of or within range
* Optionally limit heating and cooling by input from 2nd temp probe
* Button acceleration, for frustrationless programming by buttons

Quick Reference for the menus
-----------------------------

Profile (Pr0-5) menus:

|Menu item|Description|Values|
|--------|-------|-------|

|dh0|Set duration 0|0 to 999 hours|
|...|Set setpoint/duration x|...|
|dh8|Set duration 8|0 to 999 hours|
|SP9|Set setpoint 9|-40.0 to 140°C or -40.0 to 250°F|

The settings (Set) menu:

|Menu item|Description|Values|
|---|---|---|
|hy|Set hysteresis|0.0 to 5.0°C or 0.0 to 10.0°F|
|hy2|Set hysteresis for second temp probe|0.0 to 25.0°C or 0.0 to 50.0°F|
|tc|Set temperature correction|-5.0 to 5.0°C or -10.0 to 10.0°F|
|tc2|Set temperature correction for second temp probe|-5.0 to 5.0°C or -10.0 to 10.0°F|
|SA|Setpoint alarm|0 = off, -40 to 40°C or -80 to 80°F|
|SP|Set setpoint|-40 to 140°C or -40 to 250°F|
|St|Set current profile step|0 to 8|
|dh|Set current profile duration|0 to 999 hours|

Updates
-------

|Date|Release|Description|
|----|-------|-----------|
|2014-04-04|v1.00|First release|
|2014-04-11|v1.01|Increase approximative ramping steps to 64|
|2014-04-15|v1.02|Improved temperature averaging|
|2014-04-16|v1.03|Added leaky integration filtering, improved averaging (+ bugfix)|
|2014-05-25|v1.04|A couple of minor improvements and a minor bugfix|
|2014-08-02|v1.05|Reset both heating and cooling delay when either heating or cooling cycle ends. Improved power off| functionality, increased button debounce time, allow longer heating delays.|  
|2014-09-14|v1.06|Add functionality for 2nd temp probe (to limit heating/cooling). Display 'OFF' in soft off mode. Added user definable temperature alarm. Added profile 'editor' webpage.|
|2015-01-02|v1.07|Fixed bug where every other profile had wrong limits. Fixed soft on tempprobe switch bug.|
